core_process_skype

Sorry for the name of the unit I need this name cause it's a part of my TestFramework :)
This unit allows TestComplete to send messages through Skype.

So using is simple.
1. Download the Skype4COM.dll from http://developer.skype.com/accessories/skype4com 
2. Register this library like this: resvr32 skype4com.dll
3. Attach the core_process_skype.js to your TestComplete project
4. Try this script:
[JScript]
var skype = new Skype();
skype.sendMessage('user.handle', 'test');
//Just replace 'user.handle' with someone's real nickname in your Skype user list.
5. ...
6. Profit

Warning!
You shoud allow TestComplete to interact with Skype at the first run of the script.
