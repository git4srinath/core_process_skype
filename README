core_process_skype

Sorry for the name of the unit I need this name cause it's a part of my TestFramework :)
This unit allows TestComplete to send messages through Skype.

So using is simple.
[JScript]
var skype = new Skype();
skype.sendMessage('user.handle', 'test');

Just replace 'user.handle' with someone's real nickname in your Skype user list.

Warning!
You shoud allow TestComplete to interact with Skype at the first run of the script.

More info will be posted with coming article.

At this moment we can use this methods:
run
close
sendMessage
sendMessageToBookmarkedChat
sendMessageToFriend
